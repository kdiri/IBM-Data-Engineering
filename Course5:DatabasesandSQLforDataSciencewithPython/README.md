# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
-----

## Week 1

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

- You can use Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements to read and modify data. 
- The search condition of the WHERE clause uses a predicate to refine the search. 
- COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT are expressions that are used with SELECT statements. 
- INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are DML statements for populating and changing tables. 


## Week 2

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

- A database is a repository of data that provides functionality for adding, modifying, and querying the data. 
- SQL is a language used to query or retrieve data from a relational database. 
- The Relational Model is the most used data model for databases because it allows for data independence. 
- The primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each tuple or row, preventing duplication of data and providing a way of defining relationships between tables. 
- SQL statements fall into two different categories: Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.
